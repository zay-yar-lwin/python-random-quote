Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory
Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat
The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting
All warfare is based on deception
